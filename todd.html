        Todd Shelton is not your typical professor on web design. He is also a
        leader and founder of his badass 5, which consists Abbigail Merrill,
        Peyton Chester, Muj Hussain, Robert Hiland, and Stalin Thomas. I compare
        him to Chris Harrison, the host of the Bachelor franchise because he's a
        big boss to web design and a godfather to all web design in SOIC and
        Chris on the other hand, he is a godfather to all Bachelor Nation. He
        intervenes students who came in late or turn in late and he makes funny
        jokes on everything. He is a fun-loving, respectful, and a cool
        professor.
