        Stalin Thomas's first name is after Joseph Stalin (haha, kidding).
        However, Stalin is an emotional one in Todd's Badass 5. He cries when he
        has phobias on roses, boneless chickens, dusty old books, Billie
        Eillish, Halsey, and even bikini bottom from Spongebob. None other than
        his phobias, he is also a family-friend oriented and cheers to drink
        whatever the fuck he wants to drink. He is also has a fun but icy
        personality, and good friends with Muj Hussain and Peyton Chester and
        goes to parties to drink to have a good fucking time! When he's doing
        web designing work, he teaches students on web design. When he's not
        doing web designing, he invented clothing lines that made out of Twix
        and Butterfinger until the chocolate bars melt down during the summer
        and ends up licking until it stains. He is also fired from his previous
        job as a model at Abercrombie and Fitch in Keystone because his
        chocolate-covered pants was melting completely and dripped everywhere
        around in the store until the district manager had to instruct the store
        employers to clean it up! He also has a podcast and a song about
        chocolates. His song is available on Spotify and YouTube, and plays in
        the store, which a district manager told a store manager to change a
        song because he's annoying AF.
