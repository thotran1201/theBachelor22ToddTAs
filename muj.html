        Muj Hussain aka Muuuuuuj or Mujie is known as a lil' devil teaching
        assistant who is always picked on playfully by Peyton Chester due to his
        villainous personality. His ethnicity is Muslim and is considered to be
        as a lil adult with "Mic Drop" personality and a pixie cut hair.
        Unbeknownst, he has a bad habit of smelling his armpits when it comes to
        checking his pits whether it smells deodorant or "mustard." Speaking of
        armpits, his magic sentence to people when it comes to daring to smell
        his armpits: hey guys, you wanna smell my pits? Come take a whiff. He
        tends to be sensitive and laughs when it comes to hilarious situations,
        but cries when he is way too sensitive.
