        Abbigail Merrill was born in the countryside of Indiana. She is
        considered to be as a spunky, high energetic young adult when she was in
        high school. Switching her scenario of living from rural to urban, she
        became the baddest TA of Todd Shelton and is considered one of the
        Todd's Badass 5. Her badass personality lands her onto Todd's Badass 5,
        which makes her be low-key professional badass personality when it comes
        to students who did not turn their assignments on time or showing up
        late. She is also the one who pulls a "Nancy Drew" by sneaking around at
        the tutoring section and sleuthing around on her computer to see if
        someone copies someone else's code. She had enough and cries when
        someone cheats on the coding assignments. Capable of being smart, she
        secretly switches her Instagram account private because one of her
        "suspects" trying to find her "fishy" post and comment about it and
        tries to report the post. Also had enough and cries when a culprit went
        into her Instagram account and were heartbroken of what she finds, which
        causes her to get revenge. When she's not doing web designing, she took
        on the 4-H by breeding cattles and farm animals, which ultimately won
        her 4-H awards.
